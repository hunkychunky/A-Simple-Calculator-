# A Simple  JS Calculator

 A simple calculator using HTML, CSS and Javascript
 
 This is a simple calculator achieved using Javascript. The logic was a bit confusing at first as per i had to make sure that the history and output screens displayed the right content when certain inputs were made but with the help of stackoverflow and a few Youtube tutorials, I was able to make very functional.

 Screen Captured on Chrome.
